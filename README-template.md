      /*overlay effect*/
      position: fixed;
      display: none;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
      bottom: 0;
      background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
      z-index: 2;
      cursor: pointer;
}

```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
